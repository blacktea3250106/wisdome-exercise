The concept was 11 by Richard Booth, who opened the first second-hand bookshop in Hay-on-Wye, UK in 1961. Following him, many local people opened their own bookshops, and the small town soon became a model of sustainable rural development and tourism. Since the 1970s, book towns like Hay- on-Wye 12 up all over the world.      Although all book towns have a great number of bookshops, that’s where the similarities 13 . Each of these towns shows unique features of its own. Some have many small private shops, while others have organizations steered by volunteers. Some even run regular activities to attract visitors. For example, an annual book festival is held in Hay-on-Wye. Clunes, in Australia, holds a monthly book talk that hosts authors to discuss their latest 14 . As digital reading is changing our traditional way of reading, book towns like Hay-on-Wye are particularly important to 15 . The feel of a book, the smell, the weight, and the knowledge that a particular book might be more than a hundred years old—all these highlight the importance of preserving the physical book as a complement to technology.",

Then as commercial air travel became popular in the 1950s and airplanes began flying higher and faster, three planes mysteriously broke apart in midair. The cause? Square windows. Scientists found that sharp corners are natural weak spots where stress concentrates. The problem is 18 when airplanes fly at higher altitudes, where the difference between the inside and outside pressure increases, causing added stress. When subjected to repeated pressurization high in the sky, the four corners on a square window may 19 . Curved windows, on the other hand, distribute stress around more evenly, reducing the likelihood of cracks or breaks.

Thus, round windows are a major safety innovation that keeps planes from disintegrating mid-flight. They are also used on ships and spacecraft for their greater structural integrity.",

Stunt work emerged out of 22 over time. In the early days of the film industry, actors themselves shot acrobatic acts and dangerous scenes, until they began to get injured.

So the stunt industry is probably in no immediate danger of dying off.",

During this period, many people travel back to their hometowns and spend time with loved ones, both past and present. Though not a national holiday, Obon is surely one of the most traditional events of the year. Celebration often begins with mukaebi (welcoming fire), during which people make a small bonfire in front of their house to guide spirits upon their return back home. 32 Food offerings are presented at house altars and temples. Some regions prepare horses made of cucumbers and cows made of eggplants, hoping that the spirits will come back to Earth quickly, on a horse, and leave slowly, riding the cow. 33 Paper lanterns and offerings are sent floating down rivers to accompany the ancestors back to their resting place. Many areas will also organize bon-odori dances. The style of the dances varies from region to region but is normally based on the rhythms of taiko drums. Performers usually play on a tall stage with lanterns and banners strung all around. Participants, often dressed in light cotton kimonos, are encouraged to dance to the music around the stage. 34 Originally dedicated to the deceased, the dances have now become a symbol of the summer festival themselves.",

            "content": "Standing proud in the savannah with their red blankets and painted shields, the Maasai people are one of the widely known symbols of East Africa. Their unique style, as remarked by Karen Blixen, author of Out of Africa, “has grown from the inside, and is an expression of the race and its history.” The Maasai are a semi-nomadic group in Kenya and northern Tanzania, wandering in bands and living almost entirely on the meat, blood, and milk of their herds. Over the years, the fearless tribesmen have stood strong against slavery, and resisted the urging of the Kenyan and Tanzanian governments to adopt a more modern lifestyle. In fact, they are one of the few tribes that have retained most of their traditions. Up until recently, the only way for a Maasai boy to achieve warrior status was to single-handedly kill a lion with his spear. Maasai clothing varies with age, gender, and place. The most recognizable piece of clothing is the shúkà, a sheet of fabric worn wrapped around the body. Red is a popular color, and women generally opt for checked, striped, or patterned pieces of cloth. Young men wear black for several months after their circumcision, a ritual signifying their coming of age. A Maasai warrior is rarely seen without his spear and shield. In Blixen’s words, “their weapons and finery are as much a part of their being as are a stag’s antlers” (a male deer’s horns). Beadwork is an important part of Maasai culture. Beaded jewelry is made by women, and is famous for its complexity. Natural materials such as clay, shells, and ivory were used before trading with the Europeans in the 19th century. They were then replaced by colorful glass beads, allowing for more detailed beadwork and color patterns. Multicolored beadwork is popular among both men and women. Each color holds a special meaning: White stands for peace, green for land and production, while red—the most favored color among the Maasai—is the symbol of unity and bravery.     ",

            "content": "A hard hat is a helmet used mostly at worksites to protect the head from injuries due to falling objects. Since its introduction in the early 20th century, the headgear has saved countless lives and is considered the number one safety tool for construction workers. The hard hat was invented in 1919 by Edward W. Bullard, who had just returned from World War I. Before the war, workers used to smear their hats with coal tar for protection of their head. Bullard, having witnessed the life-saving power of the metal helmet in the War, decided to produce a head protection device that was affordable for every worker and lightweight enough to be worn all day long. The Hard Boiled Hat was thus born, using steamed canvas and leather, covered with black paint, and featuring a suspension system to reduce impact. Soon, hard hats became widely used. The headgear was later made mandatory at construction sites in major construction projects, such as the Hoover Dam in 1931 and the Golden Gate Bridge in 1933. Over the past century, hard hats have advanced considerably, evolving from canvas and leather to aluminum, fiberglass, and, eventually, to thermoplastic. Recently, new models have been introduced and accessories added to meet the needs of laborers working on various job sites. For instance, a ventilated hard hat was developed to keep wearers cooler, and see-through face shields were attached to better see the hazards lurking above. Today, attachments include radios, sensors, cameras, and a lot more. A common color code has also been developed for recognizing people and their roles on site. Yellow is used for general laborers and contractors, white (or sometimes black) for supervisors and managers, and green for inspectors and new workers. New products continue to expand the market. Global sales of hard hats totaled USD 2.1 billion in 2016, and are expected to reach USD 3.19 billion in 2025.",

            "content": "Zebrafish, named for their characteristic stripes, have been a popular test subject for researchers. Only a few centimeters in length, the fish breed easily in captivity, grow quickly, and their transparent body makes it easy to study their organs. Above all, they possess some amazing “self-healing” power. When part of their heart is removed, they can grow it back in a matter of weeks. When blinded, they can quickly regain the ability to see. Recent studies show that humans and zebrafish have the same major organs and share 70 percent of the genes. Moreover, 84 percent of human genes associated with disease find a counterpart in zebrafish. Scientists thus hope that understanding the self-healing mystery of the fish may one day allow humans to regenerate such organs as eyes, hearts, and spines. Researchers at Vanderbilt University are particularly interested in zebrafish retina regeneration. They have learned that damage of retina can cause blindness in zebrafish, yet it only takes about three to four weeks before vision is restored. The structure and cell types of zebrafish retinas are almost identical to those of humans. If the process can be replicated in humans, it may give rise to new treatments for blindness caused by retinal damage. In order to know exactly how zebrafish retina is regenerated, the team looked at the neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), a chemical messenger in the brain that reduces the activity of neurons. They found that lowering GABA levels in zebrafish can trigger retina regeneration, while a high level of GABA concentration will suppress the regeneration process. This suggested that GABA plays an important role in the fish’s ability to regain their sight. The team is beginning to test the GABA theory on mice. If that works, human trials will be next on the agenda. If the research proves successful in humans, some of the nearly 40 million blind people worldwide may one day have a tiny, striped fish to thank.",
